I have been trying for months to figure out my phone and it's file systems and the way it works and how it works and I don't know very much but I am very eager to learn because it is very interesting to me. The technology these days are so advanced that there's so much you can do with phones and computers and I had no idea until I started looking into it and I really want to learn how this whole system works in general and I'm starting from square One and the little tiny bit I've learned doesn't compare to any amount of technology so I would appreciate any help from anyone. So this is the start of this journey here I go.
